The Data-Collisions.csv dataset has 194673 rows and 38 columns. Each accident has an unique primary and secondary key. Each accident location is uniquely identified through ESRI 
unique identifiers and geometry fields. Description of the general location of the accident site, type of the address(whether it is an alley/block/intersection), codes identifying
the lane/crosswalk are also available in addition to the time and date of the accident.
The severity of the accident is denoted by the severity code. The type of collision, the number of people and vehicles involved, total number of injuries, further segregated by 
serious injuries and fatalities are also available.
The role of the driver in the accident, whether it was due to inattention, intoxication, weather/road conditions, speeding, whether right of way was given to pedestrian and 
whether it involved colliding with a parked car is also available in the dataset.
A few more columns are also available in the dataset which do not seem to be very useful and would be dropped for the purpose of the analysis.
